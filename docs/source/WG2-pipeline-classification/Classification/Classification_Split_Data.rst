Split data
==========

For data integration and cell type classification purposes, it is recommended to split the data into smaller subsets that reflects a single homogeneous experimental unit. In the context of cell type classification we define an *experimental unit* as the group of cells sharing similar biological and technical variance components. A batch (e.g pool/well from a single cell experiment) represents the most common experimental unit.

Therefore, we recommend splitting the data for:

1. *Faster classification/integration*. Splitting the data avoids extensive search for cell anchors and neighbors in the azimuth approach
2. *Parallelization*. Each experimental unit can be processed and analyzed independently using multiple CPU workers
3. *Avoiding intra-batch effects in the query dataset*. Cell differences driven by batch effects within the query dataset may influence the performance of the integration/alignment.

We recommend splitting the data by experimental units (e.g. batches). If the Seurat query object represents a single experimental unit, no splitting is necessary and this section can be skipped.

To split the data, we run the following code. First, let's create an output directory

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir step1_split

Let's assume we have a Seurat RDS object called ``query.RDS`` with a metadata column name called ``pool`` containing the values ``1`` and ``2`` corresponding to two independent pools. We can split the data  by pool using the ``split.R`` module.

Let's examine the parameter information:

.. code-block:: bash

  singularity exec -B $PWD cell_classification.sif \
    Rscript /split.R --help


.. code-block:: bash

  Usage: split.R [options]


  Options:
          --file=CHARACTER
                  RDS object file name

          --batch=CHARACTER
                  Batch column to split the data

          --out=CHARACTER
                  Output file name [default= split_object]

          --path=CHARACTER
                  Output path to store results [default= .]

          -h, --help
                  Show this help message and exit

We can now split the data as follows

.. code-block:: bash

  singularity exec -B $PWD cell_classification.sif \
    Rscript /split.R \
    --file query.RDS \
    --batch pool \
    --out query \
    --path step1_split

**`split.R`** takes two main arguments. ``--file`` corresponds to the seurat object filename in ``.RDS`` format. ``--batch`` expects a string corresponding to a column name in the ``@metadata`` slot. A group of RDS files following the *{out}_{batch levels}.RDS* filename pattern are created. In this example, two files called ``query_1.RDS`` and ``query_2.RDS`` are stored in the ``step1_split`` directory.

.. admonition:: Important
  :class: caution

  We strongly recommend storing results in different directories to avoid file overwriting.
