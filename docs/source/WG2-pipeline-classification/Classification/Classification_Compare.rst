Compare classifications
=======================

If two methods are used to classify cells (e.g. *azimuth* and *hierarchical scPred*), we can plot a contingeny table showing the concordance by cell type between the two methods.

Let's create an output directory

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir step5_compare

And check the input arguments

.. code-block:: bash

  singularity exec -B $PWD cell_classification.sif \
    Rscript /compare.R --help

.. code-block:: bash

  Usage: compare.R [options]


  Options:
          --file=CHARACTER
                  RDS object file name

          --xaxis=CHARACTER
                  Column in metadata

          --yaxis=CHARACTER
                  Column in metadata

          --sort=CHARACTER
                  Sort labels in both axes to match cell type hierarchy?

          --out=CHARACTER
                  Output file name [default= comp]

          --path=CHARACTER
                  Output path to store results [default= .]

          -h, --help
                  Show this help message and exit



Let's assume we have a directory called ``step4_reduce`` a single ``.RDS`` file with cells classified with azimuth and hierarchical scPred. We can generate a heatmap showing the counts and proportion of cell type concordance between the two methods as well as a text file with the numeric results as follows:


.. code-block:: bash

  singularity exec -B $PWD cell_classification.sif \
    Rscript /compare.R \
    --file step4_reduce/query.RDS \
    --out comparison \
    --path step5_compare

``compare.R`` will output two heatmap plots corresponding to counts and proportion of cell type concordance between the two methods stored in the ``step5_compare`` directory.
