QC Filtering
=============

The last part of the Demultiplexing and Doublet Detecting pipeline calculated QC metrics for each pool and across all pools.
It also produced some figures that can be used for discussion with WG1 to select final QC thresholds for this dataset.
The next sections will provide details on each figure and then provides pseudocode to help filter for high quality cells after selecting thresholds with the consortium.
